                <h3 class="text1">Web Developer</h3>
                <p class="text">I have recently completed my Bachelors in Gis specialization from the University of Karachi. Now I am taking interest in building my professional career as a Web Developer!. That sounds crazy, right?. But the thing behind this switch is
                    my love and passion for the code. I really like to do coding and stuff, although someone might say it is too late for us to change our area of expertise after High school. But I think there is no age limit for a human mind for learning
                    new skills. I am 23 now but even if I was 53, I won't hesitate to switch to programming. Good luck to me!..</p>
